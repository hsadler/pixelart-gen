# pixelart-gen
A pixelart generator using ML. Currently WIP.

## Recommendations for Further Improvement
If you want to continue improving your VAE model:
- Try different architectures: ResNet blocks or skip connections can help preserve fine details.
- Post-processing: For pixel art specifically, you could apply quantization or nearest-neighbor upscaling to maintain the pixel art aesthetic.
