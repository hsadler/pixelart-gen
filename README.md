# pixelart-gen
A pixelart generator using ML

TODO:
- [ ] Models wrapped in classes (lighning modules, take pytorch-lightning tutorial)
- [ ] Make variational by outputting a mean and a standard deviation
- [ ] Measure KL loss

"Variational" Autoencoder
VAE predict a mean and a standard deviation (sample from normal distribution)

Variational means sampling from a distribution.
